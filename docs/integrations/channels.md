# django-channels

Strawberry provides an integration for
[django-channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to allow
[subscriptions](../guide/subscriptions.md) to be used with django.

Check the [official strawberry django docs](https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/channels)
for more information on how to use it.
