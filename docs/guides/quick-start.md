# Strawberry GraphQL Django extension

This library provides toolset for GraphQL schema generation from Django models.

## Installing the package

```
pip install strawberry_graphql_django
```

## Sample project

Let's start from Django model called Fruit, which has two attributes, name and color.

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

class Fruit(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    color = models.CharField(max_length=20)
```

Soon after that your Boss comes and asks you to implement API for that model so that everyone can access our great fruit database from all over the world.

Fruit model has name and color attributes and we want to publish them both. GraphQL output type for our model is generated by using `strawberry_django.type` decorator. Both fields are char fields which means that we want to use python `str`type for them.

```python
# types.py
import strawberry_django
from . import models

@strawberry_django.type(models.Fruit)
class Fruit:
    name: str
    color: str
```

Last step is to generate Query type and Schema. Core package `strawberry` helps us here.

```python
# schema.py
import strawberry
from typing import List
from .types import Fruit

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    fruits: List[Fruit]

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)
```

Finally we add `AsyncGraphQLView` view into our urls so that we can start making first queries.

```python
# urls.py
from django.urls import include, path
from strawberry.django.views import AsyncGraphQLView
from .schema import schema

urlpatterns = [
    path('graphql', AsyncGraphQLView.as_view(schema=schema)),
]
```

After that, once the development server is running, you can read your fruits from the database.

```graphql
query {
  fruits {
    name
    color
  }
}
# -> fruits: [{ name: "strawberry", color: "red" }]
```

## Model Relations

Let's create another model called `Color` and add foreign key relation between `Fruit` and `Color` models.

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

class Fruit(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    color = models.ForeignKey('Color', related_name='fruits', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

class Color(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=20)
```

We also need to add another type and modify existing one. Field type `auto` is used for type auto resolution. `strawberry_django` goes through all fields and resolves field types. It also generates resolvers for relation fields on behalf you.

```python
# types.py
import strawberry_django
from strawberry_django import auto
from typing import List
from . import models

@strawberry_django.type(models.Fruit)
class Fruit:
    id: auto
    name: auto
    color: 'Color'

@strawberry_django.type(models.Color)
class Color:
    id: auto
    name: auto
    fruits: List[Fruit]
```

This generates schema like this

```graphql
type Color {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  fruits: [Fruit!]
}

type Fruit {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  color: Color!
}

type Query {
  fruits: [Fruit!]!
}
```

Now you can start making queries and request all fruits and their colors from the database.

```graphql
query {
  fruits {
    name
    color {
      name
    }
  }
}
# fruits: [
#   { name: "strawberry", color: { name: "red" } },
#   { name: "raspberry", color: { name: "red" } }
# ]
```
