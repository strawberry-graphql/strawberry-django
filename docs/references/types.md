# Types

## Output types

Output types are generated from models. The `auto` type is used for field type auto resolution.
Relational fields are described by referencing to other types generated from Django models.
A many-to-many relation is described with the `typing.List` type annotation.
`strawberry.django` will automatically generate resolvers for relational fields.
More information about that can be read from [resolvers](resolvers.md) page.

```python
from strawberry import auto
from typing import List

@strawberry.django.type(models.Fruit)
class Fruit:
    id: auto
    name: auto
    color: 'Color'

@strawberry.django.type(models.Color)
class Color:
    id: auto
    name: auto
    fruits: List[Fruit]
```

## Input types

Input types can be generated from Django models using the `strawberry.django.input` decorator.
The first parameter is the model which the type is derived from.

```python
@strawberry.django.input(models.Fruit)
class FruitInput:
    id: auto
    name: auto
    color: 'ColorInput'
```

A partial input type, in which all fields are optional, is generated by setting the `partial` keyword argument in `input` to `True`.
Partial input types can be generated from existing input types through class inheritance.

```python
@strawberry.django.input(models.Color, partial=True)
class FruitPartialInput(FruitInput):
    color: List['ColorPartialInput']

@strawberry.django.input(models.Color, partial=True)
class ColorPartialInput:
    id: auto
    name: auto
    fruits: List[FruitPartialInput]
```

## Types from Django models

Django models can be converted to `strawberry` Types with the `strawberry_django.type` decorator. Custom descriptions can be added using the `description` keyword argument (See: [`strawberry.type` decorator API](https://strawberry.rocks/docs/types/object-types#api)).

```python
import strawberry

@strawberry.django.type(models.Fruit, description="A tasty snack")
class Fruit:
    ...
```

### Fields

By default, no fields are implemented on the new type. For details on adding fields,
see the [Fields](fields.md) documentation.

### `QuerySet` setup

By default, a `strawberry_django` type will get data from the default manager for its Django Model.
You can implement a custom `get_queryset` classmethod to your type to do some extra processing to the default queryset,
like filtering it further.

> **Warning** This function was improperly documented prior to release: [`0.5.4`](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry-graphql-django/releases/tag/v0.5.4). Previously, the method signature was documented as: `get_queryset(self, queryset, info):` It has since changed.

```python
@strawberry.django.type(models.Fruit)
class Berry:

    @classmethod
    def get_queryset(cls, queryset, info):
        return queryset.filter(name__contains="berry")
```

The `get_queryset` classmethod is given a `QuerySet` to filter and
a `strawberry` `Info` object containing details about the request.

You can use that `info` parameter to, for example,
limit access to results based on the current user in the request:

```python
@strawberry.django.type(models.Fruit)
class Berry:

    @classmethod
    def get_queryset(cls, queryset, info, **kwargs):
        if not info.context.request.user.is_staff:
            # Restrict access to top secret berries if the user is not a staff member
            queryset = queryset.filter(is_top_secret=False)
        return queryset.filter(name__contains="berry")
```

The `kwargs` dictionary can include other parameters that were added in a `@strawberry.django.type` definition
like [filters](filters.md) or [pagination](pagination.md).
